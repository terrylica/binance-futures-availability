objective: |
  Build standalone DuckDB database tracking daily availability of all 708 USDT 
  perpetual futures from Binance Vision S3 repository. Date range: 2019-09-25 
  (first UM-futures launch) to present, with automated daily updates via APScheduler.

slos:
  availability:
    metric: "Database update success rate"
    target: "95% of daily updates complete successfully"
    measurement: "Monitor scheduler logs for successful probe completions"
    
  correctness:
    metric: "Data accuracy vs Binance exchangeInfo API"
    target: ">95% match for current date snapshot"
    measurement: "Daily validation cross-check with exchangeInfo endpoint"
    
  observability:
    metric: "Error visibility and debugging capability"
    target: "All failures logged with full context (symbol, date, HTTP status, error message)"
    measurement: "Structured logs with timestamp, level, component, error details"
    
  maintainability:
    metric: "Code testability and documentation completeness"
    target: "80%+ test coverage, all public functions documented"
    measurement: "pytest --cov, docstring coverage check"
