  title: Extract Validated Workflows into Atomic Skills
  version: 1.0.0
  status: in_progress
  implementation_date: 2025-11-17

phases:
  - name: Phase 1 - Create Skill: multi-agent-parallel-investigation
    status: pending
    est_time: 1.5-2 hours
    deliverables:
      - Create skills/multi-agent-parallel-investigation/ directory
      - Invoke skill-architecture skill with specification
      - Create SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and core workflow
      - Create references/agent-templates.md with example prompts
      - Create references/synthesis-patterns.md with decision frameworks
      - Validate with quick_validate.py
    exit_criteria:
      - SKILL.md passes validation
      - Progressive disclosure (SKILL.md < 5k words, references/ for details)
      - Generic/abstract (no ADR-0013/0014 references)
      - Domain-specific (crypto/trading context clear)

  - name: Phase 2 - Create Skill: duckdb-remote-parquet-query
    status: pending
    est_time: 1-1.5 hours
    deliverables:
      - Create skills/duckdb-remote-parquet-query/ directory
      - Invoke skill-architecture skill with specification
      - Create SKILL.md with capabilities (CAN/CANNOT sections)
      - Create references/query-patterns.md with SQL examples
      - Create references/troubleshooting.md (CORS, auth, rate limits)
      - Create scripts/benchmark-remote-vs-local.py
      - Validate with quick_validate.py
    exit_criteria:
      - SKILL.md documents DuckDB httpfs setup
      - Performance characteristics documented (1-3 sec queries)
      - Trade-offs clear (remote vs local, when to download)
      - Executable benchmark script works

  - name: Phase 3 - Create Skill: documentation-improvement-workflow
    status: pending
    est_time: 1-1.5 hours
    deliverables:
      - Create skills/documentation-improvement-workflow/ directory
      - Invoke skill-architecture skill with specification
      - Create SKILL.md with assessment checklist
      - Create references/quick-start-template.md
      - Create references/assessment-rubric.md
      - Validate with quick_validate.py
    exit_criteria:
      - SKILL.md provides systematic workflow
      - Before/after patterns documented
      - Rating criteria clear (7.5/10 → 9/10 improvement path)
      - Templates reusable for other documentation

  - name: Phase 4 - Update CLAUDE.md Link Farm
    status: pending
    est_time: 30 minutes
    deliverables:
      - Add Reusable Skills section to CLAUDE.md
      - Insert after "Related Projects", before "SSoT Documentation"
      - Add 3 skill links with one-liner descriptions
      - Verify relative paths from CLAUDE.md to skills/*/SKILL.md
    exit_criteria:
      - Link Farm follows Hub-and-Spoke pattern
      - One-liner descriptions clear and concise (10-15 words)
      - All links resolve correctly
      - Formatting consistent with existing CLAUDE.md sections

  - name: Phase 5 - Validation & Commit
    status: pending
    est_time: 30 minutes
    deliverables:
      - Run quick_validate.py on all 3 skills
      - Test skill invocation with sample problems
      - Verify CLAUDE.md links
      - Create 2 conventional commits (feat + docs)
    exit_criteria:
      - All 3 skills pass validation
      - CLAUDE.md links working
      - Conventional commits follow semantic-release format
      - feat(skills) for skill creation, docs(claude) for CLAUDE.md

slos:
  availability: "N/A (skills are documentation, not runtime components)"
  correctness: "100% (extracted from validated workflows in ADR-0013/0014, empirically tested)"
  observability: "N/A (skills don't generate telemetry, user observes invocation results)"
  maintainability: "Skill updates <1 hour per skill, follows canonical structure (22 existing skills), generic/abstract content stable (no ADR coupling)"

implementation_notes:
  - Use skill-architecture skill for all 3 skill creations (consistent structure)
  - Copy templates from /tmp/skill-design/ if available (save tokens)
  - Progressive disclosure: SKILL.md handles 80% of use cases, references/ for other 20%
  - Domain-specific but generic: crypto/trading context clear, no ADR references
  - Link Farm pattern: H3 heading + one-liner + link to SKILL.md
  - Validation via quick_validate.py: /Users/terryli/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/anthropic-agent-skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py

testing:
  validation_tests:
    - test_skill_structure: quick_validate.py passes for all 3 skills
    - test_yaml_frontmatter: name, description fields valid and within limits
    - test_progressive_disclosure: SKILL.md < 5k words, references/ exists
    - test_no_adr_references: grep for "ADR-0013" and "ADR-0014" returns empty

  integration_tests:
    - test_skill_invocation: Invoke each skill with sample problem
    - test_claude_md_links: All 3 links resolve to SKILL.md files
    - test_domain_context: Skills clearly applicable to crypto/trading data

deployment:
  phase_1_completion: TBD
  phase_2_completion: TBD
  phase_3_completion: TBD
  phase_4_completion: TBD
  phase_5_completion: TBD
  production_ready: false
  commits: []

risks:
  - risk: skill-architecture skill invocation fails (dependency on ~/.claude/skills/)
    mitigation: Manual SKILL.md creation following canonical structure from existing skills
    likelihood: LOW (skill-architecture skill well-tested)

  - risk: Skills too generic, lose crypto/trading context
    mitigation: Include domain context section, use crypto-specific examples in references/
    likelihood: MEDIUM (abstraction vs specificity trade-off)

  - risk: CLAUDE.md Link Farm becomes cluttered with many skills
    mitigation: Categorize skills when count >5, or create separate skills/README.md hub
    likelihood: LOW (currently only 3 skills)

  - risk: Skills don't match user's actual workflow needs
    mitigation: Test skill invocation with real problems, iterate based on feedback
    likelihood: LOW (extracted from validated ADR-0013/0014 workflows)

total_time: 4.5-6 hours (all phases)
